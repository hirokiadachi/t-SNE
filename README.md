# t-SNE
This code can do visuarization what recognition result distribution of Discriminator's hidden layer with t-SNE.
Discriminator learned with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  The GANs's Discriminator require that facial attribute recognition branch.

```sh
python3 t-SNE.py
```

# What is doing so
First, input the face images in Discriminator. Note, Dsicriminator use pre-trained model.
